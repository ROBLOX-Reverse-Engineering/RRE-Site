# What is Reverse Engineering?
## Introduction

[Reverse engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering) is the process of analyzing a product or system to understand how it works, in order to identify its components, their relationships, and their functions.

Reverse engineering can be used for a variety of purposes, such as identifying vulnerabilities in a system, developing compatible products or services, or creating modifications or improvements.

In the context of Roblox, reverse engineering refers to the practice of analyzing the game engine in order to understand how they work which can be used for a multitude of things including the ability to create custom modifications and extensions, discover vulnerabilities, add support for different hardware or Operating Systems, restore or add to it's functionality for older and outdated versions and much more.

## How do I get started?

Getting started with reverse engineering can be very tedious and time consuming process, especially if you're new to it.

However, here are a few steps we've put together which you can follow to get started:

1. **Familiarize yourself with the basics:** Start by learning about the fundamental concepts and tools used in reverse engineering. This can include things like disassembling, debugging, performing static and dynamic analysis, and learning how program memory works.

2. **Get the right tools:** You'll need a range of tools to get started with reverse engineering. Some of the most commonly used tools include disassemblers (like [IDA Pro](https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro/)[^1]), and debuggers (like [x64dbg](https://x64dbg.com/)).

3. **Get a good understanding of programming languages:** Having a good understanding of programming languages such as C++ and sometimes even Lua can be very beneficial when it comes to understanding and reverse-engineering the Roblox engine. Additionally, having a basic understanding of assembly will help you get a jump-start in the disassembly process that the above applications support.
