https://docs.robloxreverseengineering.net/

# How do I build this?
This project uses material mkdocs (which runs on python).

To install mkdocs-material (and it's dependencies), simply run:

    pip install mkdocs-material
    pip install mkdocs-exclude-search
    
Then run `mkdocs serve` to preview it.

You can also build it into static html files using `mkdocs build`.
