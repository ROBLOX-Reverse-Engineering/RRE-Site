# How do I build this?
This project uses material mkdocs.

To install materal mkdocs (and it's dependencies), simply run:

    pip install mkdocs-material
    pip install mkdocs-exclude-search
    
Then run `mkdocs serve` to preview it.

You can also build it into static html files using `mkdocs build`.
